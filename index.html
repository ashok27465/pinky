                            Hi my Pinky♥, here we are completing another month together, it is always a joy to be able
                            to wake up and know that I have you by my side and feel that this will be forever is
                            magnificent.
                            I want them to never end and to always have many others ahead of them.
                            You are the best thing that happened to me, thank you for choosing me every day.
                            I love you so much! ♥.
